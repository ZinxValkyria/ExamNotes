## Topic 1A: Recognize Cloud Concepts

### Fundamental Concepts:

- **Cloud Computing Basics:**
  - *Definition:* Cloud computing is a technology that enables access to computing resources over the internet.
  - *Characteristics:* On-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service.

- **Service Models:**
  - *Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):* Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
  - *Platform as a Service (PaaS):* Offers a platform allowing users to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.
  - *Software as a Service (SaaS):* Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.

- **Deployment Models:**
  - *Public Cloud:* Services are provided over a network that is open for public use.
  - *Private Cloud:* Cloud resources are used exclusively by one business or organization.
  - *Hybrid Cloud:* Combines both public and private cloud models.

## Topic 1B: Recognize Cloud Terms

### Key Terminology:

- **Elasticity:**
  - The ability to scale resources up or down based on demand.

- **Scalability:**
  - The capability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work by adding resources.

- **On-Demand Self-Service:**
  - Users can provision and manage computing resources as needed without requiring human intervention.

- **Resource Pooling:**
  - Resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.

## Topic 1C: Understand the Troubleshooting Methodology

### Troubleshooting Techniques:

- **Identify Issues:**
  - Recognize common problems related to cloud services.
