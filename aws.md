# AWS Revision

## AWS Basics

### Cloud Computing Fundamentals
- **Definition:** Delivery of computing services over the internet, including computing power, storage, and databases.
- **Key Characteristics:** On-demand resources, scalability, pay-as-you-go pricing.

### AWS Global Infrastructure
- **Regions:** Geographical areas with multiple Availability Zones.
- **Availability Zones (AZs):** Isolated data centers within regions, interconnected for redundancy.

### AWS Services
- **Compute Services:** 
  - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Virtual servers in the cloud.
  - Lambda: Serverless computing service.

- **Storage Services:**
  - S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage.
  - EBS (Elastic Block Store): Block-level storage for EC2 instances.

- **Database Services:**
  - RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed relational databases.
  - DynamoDB: NoSQL database service.

- **Networking Services:**
  - VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Isolated network within AWS.
  - Route 53: Domain Name System (DNS) web service.

- **Security and Identity Services:**
  - IAM (Identity and Access Management): Access control for AWS resources.
  - AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): Protects web applications.

## AWS Solutions

### EC2 Instances
- **Instance Types:** Vary in CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity.
- **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):** Pre-configured virtual machine image used to create instances.

### S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- **Object Storage:** Stores and retrieves any amount of data.
- **Buckets:** Containers for objects stored in S3.

### Lambda
- **Serverless Computing:** Runs code in response to events without managing servers.
- **Triggers:** Events that invoke Lambda functions.

### RDS (Relational Database Service)
- **Managed Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.
- **Automated Backups and Maintenance:** RDS handles routine database tasks.

### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- **Isolated Network:** Provides network isolation within AWS.
- **Subnets and Route Tables:** Components for defining network architecture.

## AWS Tools and Services

### AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)
- **Command-Line Tool:** Interact with AWS services using commands.

### AWS Console
- **Web-Based Interface:** Manage AWS resources through a graphical user interface.

### AWS CloudFormation
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Automate infrastructure provisioning using templates.

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Easily deploy and run applications.

## Best Practices

### Well-Architected Framework
- **Security, Reliability, Performance, Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence:** Key pillars for designing well-architected systems.

### Cost Management
- **Use AWS Pricing Calculator:** Estimate costs before deploying resources.
- **Tagging:** Label resources to track and manage costs.

### Security Best Practices
- **IAM Best Practices:** Principle of least privilege, regular audits.
- **Encryption:** Use encryption for data at rest and in transit.

### Monitoring and Logging
- **CloudWatch:** Monitor AWS resources and applications.
- **CloudTrail:** Record AWS API calls for auditing.
